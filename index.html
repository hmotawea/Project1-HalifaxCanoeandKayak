            <h2>Halifax</h2>
                <p>Date: 2023-04-12</p>
                <p>Duration: 4 days</p>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <h4>1- Halifax Citadel Ghost Walk</h4>
                <p>
                    Climb to the top of The Halifax Citadel National Historic Site and meet your historically costumed guide on the drawbridge 
                    at the main gate.  For 70 minutes, you will be led by candlelight through tunnels, prison cells, 
                    and restricted areas of Canada's most haunted historic site, to hear true accounts of unexplained events in their actual locations.
                </p>
            <h4>2- Explore Point Pleasant Park</h4>
                <p>
                    Located just minutes away from downtown, Point Pleasant Park offers a quick escape from the bright lights of the city. 
                    The park is full of running and cycling trails, and also offers up some great oceanside views and even a small beach. 
                    Throughout the park you will find historic buildings, forts and monuments. Pack a picnic and sit and listen to the waves crash, 
                    or just watch all the sailboats and ships come in and out of the harbour.
                </p>
            <h4>3- Hike Duncan's Cove</h4>    
                <p>
                    Known as one of the best coastal hikes in Nova Scotia, this hidden gem is located 25 minutes from downtown Halifax 
                    and has not one, but three beautiful sand beaches. 
                    The trail itself is 8km of coastal barrens that give way to rugged granite cliffs right on the Atlantic Ocean. 
                    Since Duncan's Cove is also a nature preserve there is a great chance that you will come across an array of wildlife 
                    on your hike including sun-bathing seals, coastal birds and even the distant whale on occasion.
                </p>
            <h4>4- Sail the Halifax Harbour</h4>
                <p>
                    The Halifax Harbour is an amazing resource. Not only does it provide great views from the Halifax and Dartmouth waterfronts, 
                    but it can be enjoyed by boat. The easiest way is to hop on the Halifax-Dartmouth ferry ($2.50/ adult). 
                    If you are going to Dartmouth on the weekend, you can also enjoy the Alderney Market for some fresh local goodies 
                    (located right inside the ferry terminal building). 
                    There are also several sailing tours that will take you around the harbour in style, 
                    including the Tall Ship Silva or even a pirate experience on the Mar. 
                    There are also several yacht clubs that give lessons in smaller sailboats. 
                    Or you can even rent kayaks or canoes from places like the St. Mary's Boat Club or Halifax Kayaks on the waterfront.
